Predicting Survival – Part 1 

Goal: Produce a species survival prediction score for use in the Targeting DB 

Process:  

The files are here S:\HortandResearchedSharedProjects\Survival\ 

Create survival data from LCMS exports 

Use R script FindSurvivalMoBot_20240306.R to take raw data from LCMS and create survival data, censor the data, then merge survival data with variables of interest from LCMS.  

Data files required: 

The R script queries ten data tables from Microsoft SQL Server PlantRecordsProd 

Output files: 

LCMSSurvivalDataIncludesAllNOTCENSORED_2024Mar_152155.txt 

LCMSSurvivalData_ 2024Mar06_161942.txt  

Create phylogeny for survival data pulled from LCMS 

Use R script FindPhylogenyForMBGSurvival20240319.R to match names with World Flora Online, then take survival data pulled from LCMS and match names to a phylogeny for analysis. 

Data files required: 

LCMSSurvivalData_ 2024Mar06_161942.txt

classification.csv [World Flora Online Backbone downloaded and unziped 2024/03/07, v.2023.06 Jun. 25, 2023] 

The R script queries the InfraspecificRank from Microsoft SQL Server PlantRecordsProd

Gather and clean GBIF occurrences for survival analysis 

Use R script GBIFDataSurvivalAnalysisPrep20240320.R to examine and subset data to find species level names, find species taxon key, find occurrences, remove bad coordinates, and export dataframe.

Create climate variables for survival analysis 

Use R script FindClimateVariables_20230320.R to match study species GBIF occurrences with climate variables, then calculate summary statistics for each species and one-sided climate variables needed for survival analysis. 

Data files required:

Perform survival analysis 

Use R script PerformSurvivalAnalysis_20230321.R to perform the mixed effects Cox model survival anaylsis

Questions for Ivan 

How to resolve nomenclatural differences between LCMS, Targeting, and GBIF and whatever taxonomic backbone we use for Targeting 

Is Worldclim our best resource for climate data? Chelsa? 

Need to calculate climate variables to put into equations to predict survival? 

What is the best way to organize this sort of work? 

 

Meet again at end of summer with Ivan to discuss next steps
